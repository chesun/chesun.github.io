# Personal Life
## Photography
I am an avid photographer. I love landscape photography the most, but when I can't
travel, I will also shoot personal projects in my local areas. My photographs
cover both wild and human-altered landscapes, and I shoot both digital and film.

## Cycling
I am also a cyclist who rides road and gravel. Feel free to check out my
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/35905919){:target="_blank"} for my rides, and my
[Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/user/1500847933178/tours?type=planned){:target="_blank"} for some
routes that I planned.
