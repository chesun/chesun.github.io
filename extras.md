## Extras
I am an avid photographer. I love landscape photography the most, but when I can't
travel, I will also shoot personal projects in my local areas. My photographs
cover both wild and human-altered landscapes, and I shoot both digital and film.

I am also a cyclist who rides road and gravel. Feel free to check out my
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/35905919) for my rides, and my
[Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/user/1500847933178/tours?type=planned) for some
routes that I planned.
