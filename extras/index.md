## Photography
I am an avid photographer. I love landscape photography the most, but when I can't
travel, I will also shoot personal projects in my local areas. My photographs
cover both wild and human-altered landscapes, and I shoot both digital and film.

## Outdoors and Travel
The great outdoors are where I feel closest to myself, and the wilderness holds a special place in my heart. 
Hereâ€™s where I share pictures and stories from my recent hikes and backpacking trips. Check out the pages below:
