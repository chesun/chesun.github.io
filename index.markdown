Welcome! My name is Christina Sun, and I am a PhD candidate in Economics at University of California, Davis. 

My research areas are behavioral economics, experimental economics, and applied microeconomics with focus on the economics of education. My current research studies the cognitive
biases that influence belief updating and discriminatory behavior. Some of my work in education include studying long-run value added of public high schools in California and peer effects of immigrant students in Texas.
