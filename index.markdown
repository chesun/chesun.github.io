# Che Sun

## Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at University of California, Davis. My main
research area is behavioral economics. My current research studies the cognitive
biases that influence belief formation and updating, with a focus on their
implications on stereotyping and discrimination. My work also spans applied
microeconomics, in particular the economics of education. I employ both lab
and field experiments in my research.


## Research Interests
Behavioral economics, experimental economics, education, and discrimination.

## Extras
I am an avid photographer. I love landscape photography the most, but when I can't
travel, I will also shoot personal projects in my local areas. My photographs
cover both wild and human-altered landscapes, and I shoot both digital and film.

I am also a cyclist who rides road and gravel. Feel free to check out my
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/35905919) for my rides, and my
[Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/user/1500847933178/tours?type=planned) for some
routes that I planned.
