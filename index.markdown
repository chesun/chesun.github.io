Welcome! My name is Christina (Che) Sun, and I am a PhD candidate in Economics at University of California, Davis. **I am on the 2025-2026 job market**.

I am an applied microeconomist studying issues in the labor market and public education. My research integrates controlled lab experiments and applied micro-econometric analysis of large administrative datasets. The goal of my research is to uncover cognitive and social mechanisms that contribute to persistent inequality, and to identify institutional factors that can promote equitable opportunity. 


## Research Interests
Behavioral and experimental economics, labor economics, and economics of education.
