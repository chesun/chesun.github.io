## Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at University of California, Davis. My main
research areas are behavioral and experimental economics with a secondary focus on the economics of education. My current research studies the cognitive
biases that influence belief formation and updating, with a focus on their
implications on stereotyping and discrimination. My work in education include studying long-run value added of public high schools, as well as the experience of students navigating the financial aid system, with a focus on the challenges faced by LGBTQ+ students.
