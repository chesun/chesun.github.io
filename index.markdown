## Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at University of California, Davis. My main
research area is behavioral economics. My current research studies the cognitive
biases that influence belief formation and updating, with a focus on their
implications on stereotyping and discrimination. My work also spans applied
microeconomics, in particular the economics of education. I employ both lab
and field experiments in my research.


## Research Interests
Behavioral economics, experimental economics, education, and discrimination.
