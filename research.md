## Work in Progress

### **Biased Belief Updating and the Persistence of Stereotypes**, with Anujit Chakraborty
We experimentally study whether gender stereotype affect belief updating on beliefs about others. Subjects perform belief updating tasks in four gender-stereotypical domains (math, sports knowledge, verbal, emotional intelligence) and one gender neutral domain (crosswords). We observe their prior, experimentally assign each subject a noisy but informative signal in each domain, and elicit updated posteriors after they receive each new signal. Comparing their belief updating between gender stereotypical domains and gender neutral domains establishes the effect of gender stereotypes on belief updating. Our design allows for precise estimation of the parameters of the subjects' belief updating rule and a clean structural test against the Bayesian baseline. We contribute to the literature by uncovering a potential channel of stereotype persistence and experimentally identify this channel separately from the other heuristics and biases that result in non-Bayesian updating.

### **Behavioral Incentive Compatibility of BDM Belief Elicitation**
Recent evidence has shown that revealing incentives during belief elicitation might negatively impact truth telling, even if the elicitation mechanism is theoretically incentive compatible. In this project, I study the effect of quantitative incentive information on truth telling in the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) belief elicitation mechanism. Subjects guess the probability of selecting a red urn out of 10 urns of colors red and blue, where the number of urns of each color is known. Results show that the treatment where subjects are shown full quantitative incentives (Full Info) does not outperform the treatment where subjects are simply told to answer truthfully (No Info). In fact, the rate of false reports is around 10 percentage points higher in the Full Info treatment, which is driven by subjects who misunderstood the incentives. Given that BDM belief elicitation is particularly difficult to explain and implement, this result shows a potentially simpler and more practical way of eliciting beliefs while maintaining quality of data.
