## Work in Progress

### **Biased Belief Updating and the Persistence of Stereotypes**, with Anujit Chakraborty
We study whether gender stereotype influences belief updating on stereotypical beliefs about
others. Subjects perform belief updating tasks in a gender-stereotypical domain (math) and a
stereotype-irrelevant, value neutral domain. We experimentally assign each subject a series 6 of
i.i.d. signals that are noisy but informative. We observe their prior and elicit updated posteriors
after they receive each new signal. Our experimental design allows for precise estimation of the
parameters of the subjects’ belief updating rule and a clean structural test against the Bayesian
baseline. We contribute to the literature by uncovering a potential channel of stereotype persistence and experimentally identify this channel separately from the other heuristics and biases that result in non-Bayesian updating.

### **Behavioral Incentive Compatibility of BDM Belief Elicitation**
Recent evidence has shown that theoretical incentive compatibility of belief elicitation mechanism doesn’t always translate into the lab and revealing incentives might negatively impact
truth telling. In this paper, I provide the first experimental evidence on the effect of incentive
information on truth telling in the BDM mechanism. The results of the experiment will inform experimenters about necessary considerations in the practical implementation of the BDM
mechanism and improve our understanding of its real-world performance. In the experiment,
subjects are asked to report their belief about the probability of 4 events which has an objective
probability. I elicit subjects’ priors and have them perform two rounds of Bayesian updating
tasks in each event. I investigate the percentage of truthful reports in each of the treatments and
the deviations between actual and Bayesian posteriors to establish the effects of incentives.
