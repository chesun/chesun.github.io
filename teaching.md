## Teaching Philosophy
My teaching philosophy is rooted in the belief that every student belongs in the classroom and has the potential to succeed. I view my role as a teacher as one of guiding students toward realizing their own potential by helping them engage with learning in a way that empowers them to think independently and become lifelong learners. To achieve this, I focus on fostering an inclusive and supportive learning environment where all students feel welcome and valued.

One of my primary goals is to make economic theory accessible and relevant by connecting concepts to real-world contexts. This helps students see how abstract ideas can be applied practically, allowing them to grasp the big picture and appreciate the relevance of what they are learning. By illustrating the importance of economics in everyday life, I aim to inspire curiosity and critical thinking.

As an educator, I believe my role is to guide students to learn how to learn, through the critical examination their learned knowledge and cultivation of critical thinking skills.  By developing assignments and exams that encourage deeper analysis and problem-solving, I help students develop critical thinking skills that will serve them not only in their academic journey, but also in their personal and civic life. Ultimately, my teaching philosophy is driven by the desire to cultivate an environment where all students can thrive and develop the tools they need to succeed beyond the classroom.

*"Christina was amazing! Great at presenting complex information in an easy manner."*

*"Christina was a wonderful TA! She evaluated our understanding of the course material and our needs from discussion at the end of every discussion section and adapted as such to give us the best experience possible. I attended almost all of the sections and they proved to be very helpful for the homework and for the exams."*

*"They were helpful and always available when students needed."*

*"Christina was great! She explained problems very well in discussion and was eager for feedback as to better help us. They made incredible handouts that were very helpful."*

*"... I appreciate that there was always room during class to ask questions."*

*"... She is active in replying the email and answering questions in class. For another, her homework focus on motivating students' economic logic. She encourages students to use their economic knowledge in their life, not limited to ecomonic questions. ..."*
