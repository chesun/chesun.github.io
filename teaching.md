## Teaching Philosophy

I see teaching as a responsibility to help students realize their potential and to empower them to become independent thinkers and lifelong learners. I teach with three core commitments: build an inclusive classroom where every student feels seen, engage students through active learning, and ground decisions in learning research. My goal is for students to connect theory to the world they live in, practice rigorous analysis, and leave confident that they belong in economics.

## Student Testimonies


Here are some excerpts from student comments in teaching evaluations. For a complete history of student teaching evaluations from my time teaching at UC Davis please <a href="https://chesun.github.io/assets/documents/StudentEval_InstructorSummaries.pdf" target="_blank">click here.</a>


*"Christina was amazing! Great at presenting complex information in an easy manner."*

*"Christina was a wonderful TA! She evaluated our understanding of the course material and our needs from discussion at the end of every discussion section and adapted as such to give us the best experience possible. I attended almost all of the sections and they proved to be very helpful for the homework and for the exams."*

*"They were helpful and always available when students needed."*

*"Christina was great! She explained problems very well in discussion and was eager for feedback as to better help us. They made incredible handouts that were very helpful."*

*"... I appreciate that there was always room during class to ask questions."*

*"... She is active in replying the email and answering questions in class. For another, her homework focus on motivating students' economic logic. She encourages students to use their economic knowledge in their life, not limited to ecomonic questions. ..."*
