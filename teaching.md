## Teaching Philosophy
My teaching philosophy is centered around providing an active learning
experience for students and enabling them to not only understand,
but also to critically examine and apply their knowledge to real-world situations.
I utilize a problem-solving based approach that is grounded in the real world
markets and institutions to stimulate critical thinking by students, and encourage
them to take on a proactive role in their own learning experience. I also employ
small group collaborations in and out of the classroom to further facilitate an
interactive and proactive learning process.

## Excerpts from Student Evaluations

### For a complete history of student teaching evaluations from my time teaching at UC Davis please <a href="https://chesun.github.io/assets/StudentEval_InstructorSummaries.pdf" target="_blank">click here.</a>

"Che explained topics from lecture with more depth and it helped retain and better understand the material."

"I attend TA Che Sun's sections this quarter and benefit a lot from them . He is patient and gives clear and effective sections. In most cases, he will summarize the main points from lectures,
and when it comes to exams, he helps us to do some preparation or analysis. He knows all the knowledge covered in classes well and explains every point in detail, and his notes are clear
and well organized, which is easy to follow. During these sections, he frequently stops and asks for our feedback and has plenty of interactions with us."

"Good economist and instructor."

"The TA was helpful in discussion and I think he provided great examples."

"The TA was very knowledgeable and was able to take the topics and break it down into digestible information for the student. He was also good at working with the professor during lecture to
make sure students questions were reviewed and looked at."

"Che has been an amazing TA for us, more than we could ever ask. He is always willing to help and really care about our success in class. We are all super grateful we have him as our TA."

"Che is the best. TA of the year or something."

"I appreciate Che's willingness to help in office hours. He always helped clarify any subjects or material I had questions on. He's a great TA."

"Che was a great TA, I'm really surprised it was his first time teaching! He was very helpful in going over the main concepts of the course and clarifying what we needed to know for midterms
or what we did wrong on midterms. He is very approachable and a cool person to talk to. He was also helpful in office hours. Che brought energy to discussions even though they were at
6pm and was always smiling! Thank you for a great quarter Che! :)"
