## Teaching Philosophy
I believe that a truly productive learning experience is one where students are encourage
to take a proactive role in the learning process and think critically, and apply their
knowledge by problem solving. Therefore, my teaching philosophy is centered around an
interactive experience in the classroom that stimulates active learning and proactive thinking. I believe the act of
thinking proactively and problem solving will help retain knowledge better and cultivate
critical, scientific thinking in students. I frequently
pose questions involving new concepts, encourage students to engage in collaborative learning with their peers to problem solve, and walk through the process step-by-step with them while
breaking it down in a digestible manner using economic intuition. I will also incorporate relevant real-world examples
to illustrate economic concepts, and demonstrate their implications for policy and
institutions, which I hope will help my students become better citizens. The effectiveness
of my teaching philosophy is demonstrated by the positive student evaluations, and
I am constantly learning from my students about what works and using their feedback
to improve my teaching.

## Student Evaluations

<!--- "Che was a great TA, I'm really surprised it was his first time teaching! He was very helpful in going over the main concepts of the course and clarifying what we needed to know for midterms or what we did wrong on midterms. He is very approachable and a cool person to talk to. He was also helpful in office hours. Che brought energy to discussions even though they were at
6pm and was always smiling! Thank you for a great quarter Che! :)"

"Che has been an amazing TA for us, more than we could ever ask. He is always willing to help and really care about our success in class. We are all super grateful we have him as our TA."

"Che explained topics from lecture with more depth and it helped retain and better understand the material."

"I attend TA Che Sun's sections this quarter and benefit a lot from them . He is patient and gives clear and effective sections. In most cases, he will summarize the main points from lectures,
and when it comes to exams, he helps us to do some preparation or analysis. He knows all the knowledge covered in classes well and explains every point in detail, and his notes are clear
and well organized, which is easy to follow. During these sections, he frequently stops and asks for our feedback and has plenty of interactions with us."

"The TA was very knowledgeable and was able to take the topics and break it down into digestible information for the student. He was also good at working with the professor during lecture to
make sure students questions were reviewed and looked at."

"Good economist and instructor."

"The TA was helpful in discussion and I think he provided great examples."

"Che is the best. TA of the year or something."

"I appreciate Che's willingness to help in office hours. He always helped clarify any subjects or material I had questions on. He's a great TA." --->
